### Traefik

This repository provides a docker-compose stack that creates a Traefik Reverse Proxy. The Traefik Reverse Proxy is configured to use a traefik based certificate for the localtest.me domain. This allows you to easily add containers to the proxy and access them at https://<container-name>.localtest.me/.
